Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption
Pixel manipulation for image encryption involves altering the pixel values of an image to obscure its contents, making it unreadable to unauthorized viewers. Here's a brief overview of the process using Python and the Pillow library (PIL):

1. Understanding Pixels: An image is composed of pixels, each of which has color values defined by RGB (Red, Green, Blue) components. Each pixel's color can be manipulated to achieve encryption.

2. Choosing an Encryption Technique: Various methods can be used for pixel manipulation, including:
   - Substitution: Replacing pixel values with other values based on a specific algorithm.
   - Permutation: Rearranging the pixel positions without changing their values.
   - XOR Operation: Using the XOR bitwise operation with a key to obscure pixel values.

3. Implementation Steps:
   - Loading the Image: Use PIL to open and convert the image into an editable format (e.g., RGB mode).
   - Manipulating Pixel Values: Access and alter the pixel values using loops or array operations, depending on the chosen encryption technique.
   - Saving the Encrypted Image: Once the pixel manipulation is complete, save the altered image back to a file format like PNG or JPEG.

4. Key Management: Securely manage the encryption key used for the manipulation, as it is crucial for decrypting the image back to its original form.

5. Decryption Process: To decrypt, the same manipulation technique must be applied in reverse using the same key.

This method provides a straightforward approach to image encryption, leveraging the simplicity of pixel manipulation while allowing for various techniques to enhance security.
